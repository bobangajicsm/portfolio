    "description": "ðŸ’ª Interfaces vs. Type Aliases in TypeScript! ðŸ’ª These two cause a lot of confusion, and the reason for it is because they are very similar. But there are some differences. Check the gif for more details ðŸ‘‡. Bottom line is that you should be using an Interface as much as possible, as it's closer to how JavaScript objects work. But if you need to use a union or tuple type, then choose Type Alias. Feel free to share this post if you find it helpful, so it can help others as well ðŸ™Œ.",
